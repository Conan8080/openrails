January 16th, 2019
This repository is a clone of the official Open Rails repository.
Moreover it includes works in progress, and also the OR_Monogame branch.
The OR_Monogame branch is based on the Monogame XNA emulation software (development version later than release 3.7.1).

CREDITS
A big CREDIT pertains to Peter Gulyas, who created the first Monogame version of Open Rails. 
His original work can be found here https://github.com/pzgulyas/OpenRails/tree/MonoGame .
Unfortunately I wasn't able to generate under GIT the development story starting from Peter Gulyas version to my version.
Dennis A T provided many important patches to the OR_Monogame branch, and performed also testing activities.


DISCLAIMER
No testing on a broad base of computer configurations and of contents has been done. Therefore, in addition
to the disclaimers valid also for the official Open Rails version,
